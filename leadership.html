                <h2>Leadership Experience</h2>
                <p><strong>Graduate Teaching:</strong> In Spring 2025 I served as the instructor of record for MATH 1050 and earned a department teaching award for my performance.</p>
                <p><strong>Graduate TA:</strong> In Fall 2024 I worked as a graduate teaching assistant for three sections of Math 0995. I managed the recitation and grading for 100+ 
                    students, breaking down foundational theorems and problem sets into logical steps. I standardized the evaluation of 100+ weekly submissions to ensure 
                    consistent and fair grading.</p>
                <p><strong>Undergraduate Tutor:</strong> Throughout my undergrad, I participated in bi-weekly volunteer tutoring with the physics and math clubs, supporting students
                across the full range of undergraduate curricula.</p>
                <p><strong>Current Tutoring:</strong> I am currently working as a physics, math, and SAT tutor for a boutique tutoring company as an advanced math and physics specialist.</p>
