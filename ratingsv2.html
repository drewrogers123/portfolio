                <h2>College Basketball Ratings System (In Development)</h2>
                <p><strong>Status:</strong> This project is currently under active development. I have adapted my Elo-based rating system to rank NCAA Division I men's basketball teams while using machine learning to optimize system parameters.
                    </p>
                <p>On January 14, I ran the model for 21 games and it predicted 16 correctly. I took note of the DraftKings moneylines for each game the night before and with a equal bet on each game, the system would have seen 4.575% profit.
                    On this given day, the system saw the best returns on bets with an implied win probability of 45% to 60%. On those bets the system would have seen a 12.3% profit. 
                </p>
                <p>The games used on 1/14 were mostly higher-seeded teams, which may have contributed to the model's success. On 1/15, there aren't many higher-seed teams playing, so I look forward to seeing the model's accuracy. I have made predictions and noted moneylines for 19 matchups and will update as soon as games are completed.</p>
