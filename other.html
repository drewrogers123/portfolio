                <h2>Projects Launching Soon and Other Ongoing Interests</h2>
                <p> <strong>Browser Extension:</strong> I'm currently developing a browser extension that hides YouTube videos behind an AI-generated practice problem set, helping users focus on learning a topic of their choice
                    while they browse the internet. The extension prompts users to solve a few problems of increasing difficulty related to their chosen subject before granting
                    access to the video content. Once complete, I will release the extension on the Chrome Web Store and make it open source on GitHub.</p>
                <p> <strong>Photo Location Tool:</strong> I'm also developing a tool that aims to guess the location of a photograph, or a arc along which a photograph could have been taken, based on a wireframe representation of
                    the mountains and terrain visible in the image. The tool uses computer vision techniques to identify key features in the photo, then matches those features against a database of
                    geotagged elevation data to narrow down possible locations. The goal is to help outdoor enthusiasts pinpoint where photos were taken, or to help search and rescue teams locate lost individuals. 
                    This project was motivated by my own experiences of trying to identify locations in my outdoor photos using the CalTopo wireframe overlay, and wanting to automate that process.</p>
                <p> <strong>Other Interests:</strong> I'm also exploring various other projects and ideas in geometric deep learning, applied measure theory, and computer vision. If you have any suggestions or would like to collaborate, feel free to reach out!</p>
