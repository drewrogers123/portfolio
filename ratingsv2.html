                <h2>College Basketball Ratings System (In Development)</h2>
                <p><strong>Status:</strong> This project is currently under active development. I have adapted my Elo-based rating system to rank NCAA Division I men's basketball teams while using machine learning to optimize system parameters.
                    </p>
                <p>On January 14, I ran the model for 21 games and it predicted 16 correctly, or a correct rate of 76%. I took note of the DraftKings moneylines for each game the night before and with a equal bet on each game, the system would have seen 4.575% profit.
                    On this given day, the system saw the best returns on bets with an implied win probability of 45% to 60%. On those bets the system would have seen a 12.3% profit. 
                </p>
                <p>The games used on 1/14 were mostly higher-seeded teams, which may have contributed to the model's success. On 1/15, there weren't many higher-seed teams playing, 
                    so I expected that the model would perform worse, and indeed it did. I ran the model on 26 games and it predicted 17 correctly, or a correct rate of 73%. I took note of the DraftKings moneylines for the first 19 games and with an equal bet on each game, the system would have seen a 12% loss.
                    The system needs an algorithm to select which games to bet on, which is a project for the next couple of days, since the current system where I select every game until I get tired of copying down moneylines is both inefficient and not scientifically sound.</p>
                <p>If you are interested in the system's details, or have any suggestions for improvement, please feel free to contact me via email at <a href="mailto:rogersdrew0123@gmail.com">rogersdrew0123@gmail.com</a>.</p>
                <p>On January 15th I added the Kelly criterion to the system. There weren't many games available to test the improvement, but the system performed well on this small sample. The system predicted 71% of games correctly, and splitting the bets 50/50 between moneyline and spread resulted in a 0.67% profit.
                    There are many more games on January 16th which should help me get a feel for how all the adjustments are affecting the system's outcomes.
